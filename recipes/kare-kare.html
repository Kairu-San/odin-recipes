    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kare-Kare holds a special place in Filipino cuisine, cherished for its rich and savory 
        sauce that envelops tender pieces of meat, often oxtail, tripe, or seafood. The dish is 
        renowned for its unique flavor profile, which comes from a thick, peanut-based sauce that's 
        been simmered to perfection. It's a comforting and hearty dish, often enjoyed with a side of 
        shrimp paste, adding a contrasting salty kick that complements the nutty sweetness of the sauce. 
        Kare-Kare is not just a meal but a cultural icon, representing the deep culinary heritage and 
        flavors of the Philippines.</p>
